      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever felt completely alone? That is how I felt when I found out
        my declining health is caused by pectus excavatum, a chest wall
        deformity. There are not as many women as men who have it and most who
        chronicle their journey are younger males. I longed to find stories of
        women like me who need surgery. I can provide personal experience,
        information, encouragement and hope through articles and video log of my
        experience. My site, Pectus Perspective will chronicle my experience and
        journey.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Pectus Perspective is for mature women with pectus excavatum looking for
        information and hope. They looking for someone who has been through the
        process diagnosis and treatment. They want to know options and outlook.
        They are between 30 to 70 years of age. Pectus Perspective users are
        health conscious and active, despite being compromised. They are looking
        for connection, community and education.

      <p>
        Pectus excavatum is a congenital chest wall deformity in which the
        sternum is concave and the chest caves inward, sometimes called a funnel
        chest or inverted sternum. While often visible at birth it is may worsen
        during adolescence. For some it is not symptomatic. For others whose
        condition is more severe it may cause wheezing or coughing, fatigue and
        decreased excercise tolerance.
