        Inverted sternum, concave chest, candy dish and ice cream bowl are all
        phrases I grew up using to describe my chest. Deformity is a word I
        never grew up using, but it is accurate. I have a deformity and its name
        is Pectus excavatum. Whenever a doctor sees it for the first time, they
        ask if I have any symptoms. When I tell them the symptoms they told me
        there was nothing to worry about.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have never been able to keep up with my peers in sports and exercise.
        I have always paid attention to my clothing so that the dent in my chest
        is not obvious. I have always been prone to respiratory infection. I
        have always had low blood pressure. I have complained of heart
        palpitations and 4 times worn a Holter monitor for 24 hours to monitor
        my heart and been told everything is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything is not fine. My symptoms began to worsen in my 40’s. Prior to
        this, while I couldn’t do as much as I wanted to, I was active in
        hiking, biking and my favorite, I love to water ski. I worked out to my
        personal capacity 3 to 5 times a week. That started to become more and
        more difficult. I thought I had allergies. It started as a light cough,
        and became constant. I found that my endurance when doing any sort of
        cardio was getting worse. I went to see an allergist. He had me do a
        breathing test that triggered a terrible attack of coughing. He
        immediately told me he suspected I do not have allergies, but asthma.
        After further testing he confirmed that my problem was asthma. He
        referred me to a pulmonologist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pulmonologist did lung function testing and found my lungs are
        functioning between 50-60%. After a cardio pulmonary exercise function
        test, he found I have severe exercise intolerance. A CT scan shows that
        my heart and lungs are compressed, with my heart shifted all the way to
        the left and pressing into my lung. It was then that he recommended me
        for surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am now waiting for my consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon. The
        surgery to correct this deformity is best done between 12-18 years of
        age. I am 50. I am working with the premier surgeon who specializes in
        working with adults. Now I am to the point that standing long enough to
        make dinner makes me tired. My heart races, skips beats, drops too low,
        and is erratic. This leaves me with chronic fatigue. Were it not for the
        Coronavirus pandemic, I would have had further testing and my
        consultation with the surgeon by now. All that was canceled as the
        corona virus situation worsened.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you, or someone you love has this condition, I have created this site
        to offer information and hope. I know I was looking for other people
        like me. People who understood a lifetime of having symptoms dismissed.
        I craved hearing about other pectus people’s experiences. Here I will
        share my experience and knowledge. I offer you that hope is always
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I know that my the best word to describe my pectus excavatum is
        miracle. My body continues to miraculously allow me to live a full life.
        The severity of Pectus Excavatum is measured by looking at the narrowest
        point on the CT scan and dividing width from side to side, by the height
        sternum to spine. This is called the Haller index. A Haller index of 2.5
        is normal, 3.5 is severe, and mine is 7.4. I have little over 1 inch
        between my sternum and spine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that my body has been able to function for so long is a
        miracle. Under tremendous stress, my body still works hard to perform at
        its best. I am learning how to work with that. We can learn together.
        Welcome to the Pectus Perspective, where hope is always available.
