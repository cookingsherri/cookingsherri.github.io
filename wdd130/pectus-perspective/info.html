        <h2>What is Pectus Excavatum?</h2>
        <p>
          Pectus Excavatum is the most common chest deformity. It affects 1 in
          500 people and is 4 times as common in males than females. Most people
          are born with it or it presents in youth. People with pectus excavatum
          have a dent in their chest. Some people have more severe forms of
          pectus excavatum (PE) and some have symptoms, while others do not. If
          you or a loved one has PE, know that life with PE can be wonderful. It
          is not a death sentence or the end of good health. Most people live
          with minimal symptoms and for those who struggle, there are options.
          It is all about how you look at it.

        <h2>What Tests Should I Have Done?</h2>
        <p>
          You need to become partners with your doctor. Many doctors are
          unfamiliar with pectus excavatum, and the medical community long
          believed it was just cosmetic. It is now coming to light that is not
          true for many. You will need to educate and advocate for yourself.
          Information will help you ask the right questions and seek for proper
          treatment. Here are some of the basics of what you might want to talk
          to your doctor about.
        </p>
        <p>
          CT Scan - This scan will determine the severity of your pectus. It can
          be helpful to scan on inhalation and exhalation. This way your are
          seeing the severity of your condition in both situations to evaluate
          how your body is being affected. From a CT scan you will receive a
          Haller index, which is a measurement to determine severity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pulmonary Function Testing - This will help the doctor determine how
          your lungs are functioning and what impact pectus may be having.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cardio Pulmonary Excercise Test - This is the classic treadmill test.
          It can also be done on a bike. This helps assess your exercise
          tolerance. It evaluates your heart and lungs and how they are
          performing during endurance excersise.
        </p>
        <p>
          EKG - An EKG measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat. This
          will help determine how your heart is functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Echocardiogram or echo report - This test allows doctors to see images
          of your heart. It will reveal if there is compression, where and how
          your health is being affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional testing may be helpful as some people with pectus excavatum
          have other issues as well. Genetic testing for Ehlers Danos and
          Marfans are common. POTS can be tested for by doing a tilt table test.

        <h2>What Are My Options?</h2>
        <p>
          There are lots of answers to this question and it is very dependent on
          your situation. You may not have symptoms severe enough to need to do
          anything. Pectus for some is cosmetic only. For those of us who have
          symptoms, the above tests will help you make a good decision about
          what treatment is right for you.
        </p>
        <h2>Surgery</h2>
        <p>
          For those who have severe pectus with severe symptoms there are
          surgical options. The first step is finding the best surgeon. Do your
          research. FaceBook has groups that can help you find recommendations
          from people who have had surgery. You will need do research the Nuss
          and Ravitch technique and consult with your cardiothoracic surgeon to
          determine what option is best for you. I chose Dr. Jaroszewski at the
          Mayo Clinic in AZ will have the Nuss procedure. My decision was that
          if the Ravitch fails, it is catastrophic. If the Nuss fails, further
          repair is available.
