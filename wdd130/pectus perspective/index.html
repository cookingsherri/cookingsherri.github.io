        Have you ever felt completely alone? That is how I felt when I found out
        my declining health is caused by pectus excavatum, a chest wall
        deformity. There are not as many women as men who have it and most who
        chronicle their journey are younger males. I longed to find stories of
        women like me who need surgery. I can provide personal experience,
        information, encouragement and hope through articles and video log of my
        experience. My site, Pectus Perspective, will chronicle my experience and
        journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pectus Perspective is for anyone with pectus excavatum looking for
        information and hope.
