        <h3>A Whale of a Tale</h3>
        <h4>by Sherri Walter</h4>

        <p>
          I was raised by a liar. The best liar. He told me a whopper that was
          so obvious I should have spotted it.</p>
          <p>I didn’t. </p>
          <p>I was a grown woman
          before my husband spotted it for me. And had great fun pointing it out
          to me. To this day, it is one of “our” stories. Every couple has those
          stories you pull out at parties when you want to be entertaining.
          Because the truth is, it is down right funny. Laugh out loud funny.
          Hysterical, really. Even I have to admit it. Even though it makes me
          look like a ditz.</p>
          <p>Here’s the deal. I grew up a very rich kid. And I
          didn’t know it. Had no idea. Because Dad lied. I believed a whopper
          the size of a whale until I was a grown woman. I defended this lie          
          vehemently because I believed in it so much.</p>
          <p>all started when we
          were having dinner with friends. I was telling our friends at dinner
          how much fun we used to have as a family living in Southern California
          going to Catalina Island for the weekend. In our boat. My husband was
          interested in the details. Where did we sleep? On the boat. He is
          thinking ski boat, where the seats pull out into beds. No, I tell him.
          There were beds. Real beds. He thinks there is a small cabin below
          deck. I tell how my dad was an amazing boat driver. Mom used to bring
          her card club friends out on the boat when it was her turn to host.
          Sometimes one of the cards would float away in the breeze. Dad was
          such a good boatman, he could get close enough to the card floating on
          the water so that mom could lean over and pick it up. My husband is
          not interested in Dad’s captain abilities. He is stuck on card club.</p>
          <p>“How could they play cards on the boat?” My hubby wants to know. “On
          their laps?” he asked. No. Folding tables. We set them up on the deck.
          My dad was crazy, amazing piloting that boat. My husband is not
          interested in Dad. He says, “Did you say tables? As in plural, more
          than one?” He is annoying me with his attention to trivial details.
          Yes, there was more than one. Three, maybe four. I don’t really
          remember. He interrupts me again. He feels three or four card tables
          on the deck means this is a really big boat. It was seafaring. It was
          bigger than a ski boat, but not huge, I tell him.</p>
          <p>I have moved on to
          telling him about the time we saw whales on the way to Catalina. Now
          my husband wants to know what we did if we had to go to the bathroom
          while we were making the trip, or in the middle of the night. The boat
          had a small bathroom. I try to get the conversation back to the
          whales. “Boats don’t have bathrooms. I think it was a yacht.” My
          husband has a thing about interrupting good stories. Little girl that
          I was, I thought the whales were small islands. I spotted them first
          and pointed them out to my dad. They were big enough you could walk on
          them. Dad was kind of nervous about the whales. “What about eating?”
          He was interrupting again! Annoying much? The whales weren’t eating.
          They were just swimming. “No, what did you eat on these weekends to
          Catalina?” he wanted to know. Abalone. My dad and his friends loved to
          catch them and cook them up fresh, but I thought they were rubbery and
          gross.</p>
          <p>“Where did they cook them?” Now we were getting to what my
          husband was driving at. “Was there a kitchen on the boat?” Of course
          not! There was, however, a small sink, fridge and stove that Mom and
          Dad called the galley. “That’s a yacht!” My husband is persistent. I
          explain the technicalities as Dad explained them to me. The official
          length for a boat to be a yacht is 43 feet. Our boat, The Ranger II, a
          top of the line Hatteras, was 42 feet and therefore under the legal
          limit to be considered a yacht.</p>
          <p>That’s a whopper.</p>
          <p>A whale of a tale.</p>
          <p>I
          bought it hook, line and sinker. I guess Dad thought that snooty girls
          who knew the truth were worse than down to earth girls who were
          gullible. So he lied. And I believed it, well in to my twenties.</p>
            <p>Come April 1 to How Big Was That Fish Day and share your whale of a tale.</p> 
            <p>I promise to believe you.</p>
