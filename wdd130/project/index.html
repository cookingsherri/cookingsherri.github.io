          <h2>We run Rivers to relax.</h2>
          <p>
            We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for
            <em>relaxing</em>. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar
            philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking
            time to look around and notice the <strong>beauty</strong> that
            surrounds the rivers we love.

          <h2>We run Whitewater for the Rush</h2>
          <p>
            That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things
            after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are
            looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you
            appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
