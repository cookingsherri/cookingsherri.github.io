        <p class="home-paragraph-1">
          We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for
          <em>relaxing</em>. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy
          of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look
          around and notice the <strong>beauty</strong> that surrounds the
          rivers we love.

        <h2 class="home-headline-2">We run Whitewater for the Rush</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2">
          That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things
          after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are
          looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate
          the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
