            Have you ever felt completely alone? That is how I felt when I found out
            my declining health is caused by pectus excavatum, a chest wall
            deformity. There are not as many women as men who have it and most who
            chronicle their journey are younger males. I longed to find stories of
            women like me who need surgery. I can provide personal experience,
            information, encouragement and hope through articles and video log of my
            experience. My site, Dear Candy Dish will chronicle my experience and
            journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dear Candy Dish is for anyone with pectus excavatum looking for
            information and hope.</p>
