        <h3>Target</h3>
        <a href="https://www.target.com/">Target Website</a>
        <img
          src="../images/www.target.com_(iPhone_X).png"
          alt="Target Mobile Screenshot"
        />
        <p>
          Target repeats the colors yellow, gray and white to create a feeling
          of coherence among the images. By going across the top and using the
          rule of thirds on the bottom, the designer creates a feeling of
          balance. Target also really uses alignment well here. The line where
          the yellow and gray meet at the bottom lines up with the jumping man's
          feet and knees. The text at the bottom aligns with the images above on
          the left border. This repetition of elements gives this page a
          dynamic, and energetic feel.

        <h2 class="design-element">White Space</h2>
        <h3>Annie Selke</h3>
        <a href="https://annieselke.com/">Annie Selke Website</a>
        <img
          src="../images/annieselke.com_(iPhone_X).png"
          alt="Annie Selke Mobile Screenshot"
        />
        <p>
          In contrast to Target, where the design takes up all negative space,
          Annie Selke's design leave a small border around the entire body.
          While Target's images are right up against each other, Annie Selke
          leaves a small amount of space around each image. This is a very clean
          and minimal design. There is not even much color text or background.
          Even the colors in the images are soft, muted and similar. The feel of
          this page, is calm and relaxed. The amount of white space on this page
          is pleasing to the eye and has much more relaxed feel than Target's.

        <h2 class="design-element">Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3>One Kings Lane</h3>
        <a href="https://www.onekingslane.com/">One Kings Lane Website</a>
        <img
          src="../images/www.onekingslane.com_(iPhone_X).png"
          alt="One Kings Lane Mobile Screenshot"
        />
        <p>
          One Kings Lane uses hierarchy to draw attention to one thing. They are
          having a sale! We know this because the text with this information is
          larger than anything on the page. Quite often, for branding, a company
          will want to bring attention to their logo. In this example, the logo
          is not pullilng attention by either size or color. We see the top band
          of color is also advertising the sale and vying for attention. Even
          the 20 percent is thicker and has more weight in addition to its size
          to compete for attention. This makes it clear that the most important
          information the advertiser wants us to have is there is a sale at 20%
          off.
