      <p>
        John is a 30 year old project manager for an identity managment team
        that works at different locations and time zones. He is looking for a
        corporate retreat for his team to create unity. He is looking for an
        activity that will push team members out of their comfort zone and
        create a bond. His team does not do much outdoors, so he wants to make
        sure he chooses an adventure that is not beyond anyones skill level.

        this year. She is looking for an activity that will be exciting and
        appeal to a variety of ages. One of the things she is looking for is a
        photo opportunity. She loves sharing photos online and wants an
        adventure that has professional photography available to capture the
        moment. She wants something that is affordable, but not so affordable that it is not memorable.
